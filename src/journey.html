    <p>I was born and raised in ogden. I moved around a lot because of the lack of money my mom had. I started living with my dad recently and he helpsme more with acedemics. one day, he told me about this summer program at weber state. It was super hard trying to keep up with the assignments but i got it. The hardest part of this program for me, was not learning the material, but the fact that im not used to saving things to my drive and these computers dont save anything once its turned off.</p>
    <p>I especially liked learning about Flexbox, media queries, and creating cool effects with CSS.
